General Chemistry Laboratory 
initiated 04-Nov-2019

    DESCRIPTION:
A calculation interface for use in college-level general chemistry laboratory courses.  
Features common functions and conversions useful to both faculty and students.

    CALCULATORS IN-DEVELOPMENT:
    
+ Dilute Stock Sol'n (M1V1=M2V2)
        Solve for M1 & V of H2O added
        
+ Error Analysis (%Error & &Yield)
        Solve for %Error
        Solve for %Yield    
        
+ Ideal Gas Law (PV=nRT) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law)
        Solve for P;  Given V or T
        Solve for V;  Given P or T
        Solve for T;  Given P or V
        
+ Titration Curve Analysis (Plot: pH vs. Volume; IMPORT .xlsx or .csv file)
        Solve for half-equivalence point;
        Solve for full-equivalence point;


+ Soluability Tester
+ Reaction Order Analysis
+ Enthalpy of Reaction
